This repo is just a little test for a video i made after ripping the transcript of the a video i made about a software process (in this instance, making a reddit account)
the idea was to parse this out into a json object to later turn into a pseudocode type of instruction list that would be the intermediary step to making an automation script.

You'll need to provide your own OPENAI API creds to get this to work
